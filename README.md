Having spent 5 years in London working with Financial Services firms (FinTech's, Hedge Funds, Investment Banks), I moved to Los Angeles in 2019 to utilize my experience across the US market, including the Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York City. I have a solid understanding of Software Development practices and technologies, as well as Financial Products.

In my spare time I enjoy skiing, travelling and hiking.
